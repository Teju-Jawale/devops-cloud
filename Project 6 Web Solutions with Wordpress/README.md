# Welcome to the Web Solutions with WordPress in AWS project!

## Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to deploy a full-scale web solution using WordPress CMS and MySQL RDBMS in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The project will cover the configuration of the Linux storage subsystem and the deployment of a WordPress website using AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with AWS services and CentOS operating system
- Basic understanding of Linux storage subsystem
- Familiarity with WordPress CMS and MySQL RDBMS

## Getting Started

1. Install CentOS on the AWS EC2 instance.
2. Configure the Linux storage subsystem by creating a new logical volume and formatting it with the ext4 file system.
3. Create an EBS volume and attach it to the EC2 instance.
4. Install MySQL RDBMS on the EC2 instance and configure it to use the EBS volume for data storage.
5. Install WordPress CMS on the EC2 instance and configure it to use the MySQL RDBMS.
6. Configure the WordPress website by setting up the site title, tagline, and timezone.
7. Test the website's functionality, including logging in, creating posts, and commenting.

## Configuring Linux Storage Subsystem

1. Log in to the EC2 instance using SSH.
2. Create a new logical volume using the `lvcreate` command.
3. Format the logical volume with the ext4 file system using the `mkfs.ext4` command.
4. Mount the logical volume to the desired directory using the `mount` command.

## Deploying WordPress CMS

1. Download the WordPress CMS package from the official website.
2. Extract the package to the desired directory using the `tar` command.
3. Change the ownership of the WordPress directory to the Apache user using the `chown` command.
4. Configure the Apache server to serve the WordPress website using the `httpd.conf` file.
5. Create a new MySQL database for WordPress using the `mysql` command-line tool.
6. Configure the WordPress database settings in the `wp-config.php` file.
7. Install the WordPress plugins and themes as needed.

## Configuring MySQL RDBMS

1. Install the MySQL RDBMS package on the EC2 instance using the `yum` command.
2. Start the MySQL server using the `mysql.server` command.
3. Create a new MySQL database for WordPress using the `mysql` command-line tool.
4. Configure the MySQL database settings in the `my.cnf` file.
5. Grant permissions to the WordPress user for the database using the `GRANT` command.

## Using AWS EBS Volumes

1. Create an EBS volume using the AWS Management Console.
2. Attach the EBS volume to the EC2 instance using the `aws ec2 attach-volume` command.
3. Format the EBS volume with the ext4 file system using the `mkfs.ext4` command.
4. Mount the EBS volume to the desired directory using the `mount` command.
5. Configure WordPress to use the EBS volume for data storage.

## Troubleshooting

1. SSH connection issues:
   - Check the SSH key pair is properly configured.
   - Check the security group settings to ensure that SSH traffic is allowed.
   - Check the instance's network ACL to ensure that SSH traffic is allowed.
2. MySQL connection issues:
   - Check the MySQL server is running and available.
   - Check the MySQL database credentials.
   - Check the MySQL connection settings in the `wp-config.php` file.
3. WordPress functionality issues:
   - Check the WordPress installation directory and files.
   - Check the WordPress database settings in the `wp-config.php` file.
   - Check the WordPress plugin and theme files.
