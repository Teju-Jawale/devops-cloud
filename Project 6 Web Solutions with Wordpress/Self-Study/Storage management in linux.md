## Introduction

Linux offers a robust set of tools and commands for managing storage and disk space. Whether you're a system administrator or a casual user, understanding these tools is essential for maintaining a well-functioning system. This guide will provide you with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively manage storage and disk space in Linux.

## Understanding Linux File Systems

Linux supports various file systems, each with its own features and use cases. Some of the most common file systems include:

- **ext4**: The default file system for many Linux distributions, known for its reliability and performance.
- **XFS**: A high-performance file system suitable for large files and high-capacity storage.
- **Btrfs**: A modern file system with advanced features like snapshots, subvolumes, and built-in RAID support.

### Choosing the Right File System

- **ext4**: Ideal for general-purpose use.
- **XFS**: Best for large-scale data storage and high-performance applications.
- **Btrfs**: Suitable for advanced users requiring features like snapshots and dynamic disk management.

## Disk Partitioning

Partitioning a disk involves dividing it into separate sections, each of which can be managed independently. This allows for better organization and management of data.

### Tools for Disk Partitioning

- **fdisk**: A command-line utility for managing disk partitions.
- **parted**: A more advanced tool for creating and managing partitions.
- **GParted**: A graphical interface for managing partitions.

### Basic Partitioning with `fdisk`

1. **List Partitions**:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk -l
   ```
2. **Select Disk**:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
   ```
3. **Create Partition**:
   - Enter `n` to create a new partition.
   - Follow the prompts to specify the partition size and type.
4. **Write Changes**:
   - Enter `w` to write the changes to the disk.

## Mounting and Unmounting File Systems

Mounting a file system makes it accessible to the operating system, while unmounting disconnects it.

### Mounting a File System

1. **Create Mount Point**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/mydisk
   ```
2. **Mount Disk**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/mydisk
   ```

### Unmounting a File System

1. **Unmount Disk**:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /mnt/mydisk
   ```

### Persistent Mounts

To ensure a file system is mounted automatically at boot, add an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file.

## Logical Volume Management (LVM)

LVM provides a flexible way to manage disk space by allowing you to create, resize, and move logical volumes without unmounting file systems.

### Basic LVM Commands

1. **Create Physical Volume**:
   ```bash
   sudo pvcreate /dev/sdX
   ```
2. **Create Volume Group**:
   ```bash
   sudo vgcreate myvg /dev/sdX
   ```
3. **Create Logical Volume**:
   ```bash
   sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n mylv myvg
   ```
4. **Format and Mount**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/mylv
   sudo mount /dev/myvg/mylv /mnt/mydisk
   ```

## Disk Usage and Monitoring

Monitoring disk usage helps prevent issues related to disk space exhaustion.

### Useful Commands

- **df**: Displays disk space usage.
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
- **du**: Shows disk usage of files and directories.
  ```bash
  du -sh /path/to/directory
  ```
