# Load Balancer Solution with Nginx and SSL/TLS

![image](image/nginx.svg)

In this project, we will learn how to configure an Nginx Load Balancer solution and ensure secure connections to your web solutions using SSL/TLS certificates. This will help us understand the importance of load balancing and secure connections in a real-world scenario.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, we will be able to:

1. Configure Nginx as a Load Balancer
2. Register a new domain name and configure secured connection using SSL/TLS certificates

## Why Load Balancer and SSL/TLS?

Load balancers are essential for managing high traffic websites and ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed with requests. Nginx is a popular open-source load balancer that can be configured to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.

SSL/TLS is a security technology that protects connections from Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks by creating an encrypted session between the browser and the web server. SSL/TLS uses digital certificates to identify and validate a website, ensuring that the connection is secure and trustworthy.

## Project Overview

This project consists of two parts:

1. **Configure Nginx as a Load Balancer:**

   Load balancing is a technique used to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed with requests. In this part of the project, we will learn how to configure Nginx as a load balancer and distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.

2. **Register a new domain name and configure secured connection using SSL/TLS certificates:**

   When data is moving between a client (browser) and a web server over the internet, it passes through multiple network devices. If the data is not encrypted, it can be easily intercepted by someone who has access to the intermediate equipment. In this part of the project, we will learn how to register a new domain name and configure a secured connection using SSL/TLS certificates.

## Target Architecture
