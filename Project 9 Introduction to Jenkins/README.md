## Tooling Website Deployment Automation with Continuous Integration and Jenkins

This README outlines the process of automating the deployment of your Tooling Website using Jenkins, a popular CI/CD tool. This project builds upon the architecture established in Project 8, which included horizontal scalability with multiple web servers and a load balancer.

### Project Goals

- **Automate Deployment:** Eliminate manual deployment tasks and ensure consistent, repeatable deployments.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrate Jenkins into your workflow to automatically build, test, and deploy changes from your GitHub repository.
- **Improved Agility:** Achieve faster release cycles and enhance the overall development process.

### Architecture Overview

The updated architecture includes a Jenkins server, which acts as the central hub for CI/CD operations.

**Components:**

1. **GitHub Repository:** Your source code for the Tooling Website is hosted on GitHub.
2. **Jenkins Server:** The automation server responsible for building, testing, and deploying code changes.
3. **NFS Server:** A shared network file system used to store the website's files.
4. **Web Servers:** The servers that run your Tooling Website, receiving traffic from the load balancer.
5. **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic across the web servers.

**Workflow:**

1. **Code Changes:** Developers commit changes to the GitHub repository.
2. **Jenkins Trigger:** Jenkins detects changes and triggers a job based on predefined configurations.
3. **Build & Test:** Jenkins builds the code, runs tests, and ensures code quality.
4. **Deployment:** Jenkins deploys the updated code to the NFS server.
5. **Web Server Updates:** Web servers automatically pull updates from the NFS server, ensuring the website reflects the latest code changes.

### Task Breakdown

1. **Install and Configure Jenkins:**
   - Install Jenkins on a separate server.
   - Configure Jenkins to access your GitHub repository and the NFS server.
2. **Create a Jenkins Job:**
   - Define a Jenkins job that triggers on code changes in your GitHub repository.
   - Configure the job to:
     - Pull code from GitHub.
     - Build the website.
     - Run tests (if applicable).
     - Deploy the updated code to the NFS server.
3. **Configure Web Servers:**
   - Ensure web servers are configured to automatically pull updates from the NFS server.

### Benefits of CI/CD with Jenkins

- **Faster Releases:** Automated deployments significantly reduce the time it takes to release new features or bug fixes.
- **Improved Quality:** CI ensures that code changes are tested before deployment, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Automation frees up developers to focus on more complex tasks.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** CI/CD facilitates better communication and collaboration between development and operations teams.

### Next Steps

- **Implementation:** Follow the detailed instructions provided in the Jenkins documentation and GitHub resources to set up your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your deployment process to ensure it works as expected.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor the health of your Jenkins server and the deployment process to identify and resolve any issues.
