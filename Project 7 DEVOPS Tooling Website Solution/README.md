# DevOps Tooling Website Solutions: Multi-Tier Web Application

## Overview

This DevOps project aims to build a multi-tier web application with the following components:

1. **Infrastructure**: AWS
2. **Web Server**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
3. **Database Server**: Ubuntu 24.04 + MySQL
4. **Storage Server**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server
5. **Programming Language**: PHP
6. **Code Repository**: GitHub

## Architecture

The project follows a multi-tier architecture, with each component deployed on a separate server or service. The overall architecture can be depicted as follows:

```
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
|    Web Server    |     |  Database Server |     |  Storage Server  |
|   (RHEL 8)       |     |   (Ubuntu 24.04) |     |   (RHEL 8 + NFS)  |
|                  |     |                  |     |                  |
|     +---------+  |     |  +---------+    |     |  +---------+     |
|     | PHP App |  |     |  |  MySQL  |    |     |  |   NFS    |     |
|     +---------+  |     |  +---------+    |     |  +---------+     |
|                  |     |                  |     |                  |
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
           |                       |                        |
           |                       |                        |
           |                       |                        |
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
|     AWS          |     |     AWS          |     |     AWS          |
|   Infrastructure |     |   Infrastructure |     |   Infrastructure |
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
```

## Components

### Infrastructure (AWS)

The entire infrastructure will be hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), leveraging various services such as EC2, VPC, and EBS.

### Web Server (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8)

The web server will be running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL 8) and will host the PHP application. The server will be configured with Apache or Nginx as the web server, and necessary PHP dependencies will be installed.

### Database Server (Ubuntu 24.04 + MySQL)

The database server will be running Ubuntu 24.04 and will host a MySQL database instance. The database will store the application data.

### Storage Server (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server)

The storage server will be running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and will serve as an NFS server, providing shared storage for the application.

### Programming Language (PHP)

The web application will be developed using the PHP programming language, taking advantage of its flexibility and wide adoption in the web development community.

### Code Repository (GitHub)

The source code for the web application will be stored and managed using a GitHub repository. This will enable version control, collaboration, and streamlined deployment processes.

## Deployment Workflow

The deployment workflow for this project will involve the following steps:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Set up the necessary AWS resources, including EC2 instances, VPC, and EBS volumes, using infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
2. **Server Configuration**: Provision and configure the web server, database server, and storage server using configuration management tools like Ansible or Puppet.
3. **Application Deployment**: Deploy the PHP application to the web server, configure the database connection, and set up the NFS-based shared storage.
4. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

## Documentation

For detailed instructions on setting up the infrastructure, configuring the servers, and deploying the application, please refer to the project's wiki or documentation repository.

## Conclusion

This DevOps project aims to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable multi-tier web application by leveraging various technologies and best practices in the DevOps domain. The use of AWS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, MySQL, NFS, and GitHub enables a highly reliable and secure solution that can be easily deployed and managed.
